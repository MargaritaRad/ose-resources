QuantEcon
=========

`QuantEcon <https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/>`_ is an initiative by `Thomas J. Sargent <http://www.tomsargent.com/>`_ and `John Stachurski <http://johnstachurski.net/>`_. It is very well suited for inexperienced programmers. Besides explaining some components of structural models in detailed and simple to follow tutorials, it also teaches the basics of Python and Julia.

The most notable links you should check out are:

`Introduction to Python <https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index_learning_python.html>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This will guide you through the set-up of Python on your computer, explain the basic syntax and data structures. It is quite fast paced but self-contained.

`Scientific Python Libraries <https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index_python_scientific_libraries.html>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core Python language is not designed for scientific computing. Instead, this is delegated to other packages. Here you will get an overview of the main Python packages you will need:

* `Numpy: <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/>`_ provides multi-dimensional arrays and functions to work on them.

* `Matplotlib: <https://matplotlib.org/>` simple plotting in Python. While it is good to understand the basics of matplotlib, we would suggest that users use the much simpler seaborn library that builds on top of matplotlib and produces beautiful graphs out of the box

* `Scipy: <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.3.0/reference/>` Toolkit for scientific computing. Examples are optimization, numerical integration and random number generation.
Numba: A just in time compiler for Python that can make Python about as fast as Fortran or C. Seriously, try it out. It's amazing!

`Dynamic Programming <https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index_dynamic_programming.html>`_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A great introduction into the theory and implementation of simple dynamic programming models.
