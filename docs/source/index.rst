Welcome to StructResources
==========================

Here we list resources for students or researchers who want to start to solve and estimate structural economic models. Due to our background we focus mainly on microeconomic applications but also try to include a few resources for macroeconomic models. If you know another good tutorial or python package for structural econometrics, please let us know, so we can add it. If you are the author of one of the packages or tutorials we list, and think our description is outdated or not accurate, please open an `issue <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/StructResources/issues/new>`_  or submit a `pull <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/StructResources/compare>`_ request on GitHub.
